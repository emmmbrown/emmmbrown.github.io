<p> Hey there. I've decided to start a blog chronicling my explorations in data science
and visualizations. </p>

<p>I've built this blog with the 
<a href="https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">Clean Bootstrap Theme for Jekyll</a>
and GitHub pages. I'm going to try and use only images that I've taken, but I'll note
when they're not. For instance, this image is from <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons/'>
Nasa on the Commons</a> since it was included in the template and I felt it was oddly appropriate. </p>

<p>I've decided my first project will be examining economic inequality in
Cambodia, since it really struck me while I was there a year ago. </p>

<p> I'll keep tweaking this as time goes along; it's not quite perfect yet. </p>

<p>Thanks for checking this out! </p>
